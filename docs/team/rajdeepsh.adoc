== PROJECT: Student Management System

---

== Overview

*Student Management System (SMS)* is a desktop application which uses a CLI for its interactions.
SMS is targeted mainly at university lectures as it allows them to easily organise and manage their students and classes with a variety of newly implemented group features such as creating of groups, adding students to groups etc.
SMS removes the task of manually distributing students equally with the ability to distribute students automatically based on a specified criteria.
SMS allows lecturers to make quick responses by sending emails to groups of students.
SMS also provides other neat features such as assigning test grades to students.
Lecturers can further automate some of these processes by importing student data given by their departments.

== Summary of contributions
* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=rajdeepsh[Code]]
* *Main Feature*: *Groups*
** *Functionality*: Added *the ability to create groups*
*** What it does: Allows the lecturer to create a groups in the student management system and displays the groups created on a separate panel.
*** Justification: This feature is necessary as it allows the lecturer to have a list of all his modules/tutorial groups.
*** Highlights: This feature required an in-depth analysis of storage alternatives as storing group data in a separate xml file would be more modular but difficult to implement, given our time constraints.

** *Functionality*: Added *the ability to select groups*
*** What it does: Allows the lecturer to select groups in the student management system via a CLI command and displays the students in the group selected on a separate panel.
*** Justification: This feature was implemented to allow for some flexibility when it comes to inputs as some lecturers may prefer typing over clicking.
*** Highlights: This feature was to be paired later on with a find group feature, but due to time constraints find group was not implemented.

** *Functionality*: Added *the ability to add students to groups*
*** What it does: Allows the lecturer to add students to existing groups in the student management system.
*** Justification: This feature is necessary as it allows the lecturer to have a list of students in a particular module/tutorial group.
*** Highlights: This feature was to be further improved by synchronizing it with the edit command - e.g. if a person is edited in the
student management system, that person would also be edited in all the groups he/she is in by simply removing the old person and adding the updated person. However,
 due to time constraints, it was not further improved.

** *Functionality*: Added *the ability to delete groups*
*** What it does: Allows the lecturer to remove groups from the student management system.
*** Justification: This feature is necessary as it allows the lecturer to organize/edit the management system.

** *Functionality*: Added *the ability to delete students from groups*
