== PROJECT: Student Management System

---

== Overview

*Student Management System (SMS)* is a desktop application which uses a CLI for its interactions.
SMS is targeted mainly at university lectures as it allows them to easily organise and manage their students and classes with a variety of newly implemented group features such as creating of groups, adding students to groups etc.
SMS removes the task of manually distributing students equally with the ability to distribute students automatically based on a specified criteria.
SMS allows lecturers to make quick responses by sending emails to groups of students.
SMS also provides other neat features such as assigning test grades to students.
Lecturers can further automate some of these processes by importing student data given by their departments.
